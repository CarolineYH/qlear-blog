Today at QLEAR, we are deepening our partnership with Kaiterra by welcoming the **Sensedge**, the most sophisticated commercial-grade indoor air quality monitor, to our growing list of supported devices. Designed for accurate, continuous, and secure tracking of indoor air quality, the Sensedge offers a complete IAQ monitor for commercial needs. This includes sensors for PM 2.5, TVOC, carbon dioxide, temperature, and humidity, with a touchscreen display.
