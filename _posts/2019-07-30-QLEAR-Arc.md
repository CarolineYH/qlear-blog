On July 25th at Greenbuilder 2019 in San Francisco, QLEAR and Arc announced a new partnership that automates data flows between their respective software platforms for LEED certification and recertification purposes.

> _“Our new partnerships make it faster and easier than ever for project teams to measure environmental impact, improve their performance and achieve LEED certification.”_ 
>
> \- Chris Pyke, Senior Vice President, Product, Arc Skoru Inc.

> _“The QLEAR / Arc integration enables our clients to get the most possible value out of their data; from daily building operations through to certification and communication. We witnessed this with the [Starbucks Roastery](https://www.reset.build/projects/142) in Shanghai - the world’s first project to pilot the integration - and we’re now extending the value to the rest of out clients.”_

> \- Alessandro Bisagni, QLEAR Partner.

This new partnership makes QLEAR the world’s first and only environment quality platform able to contribute directly to both LEED and RESET certification programs and software platforms.
