Welcome to our new website! We've been working hard over the past few months to better understand how our users understand and use QLEAR. Taking what we've learned, we are deep into a full product redesign to better meet your needs. Today, we are excited to release the first part of this process, our company website and domain.

Since QLEAR launched nearly four years ago, our userbase and product features have changed signficantly, and in our research we found that many vistors and potential users of QLEAR were uncertain of how QLEAR works, and how it can help them improve the indoor environment. This new website marks the first step in better communicating the potenial of QLEAR.

Jekyll supports the use of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) with inline HTML tags which makes it easier to quickly write posts with Jekyll, without having to worry too much about text formatting. A sample of the formatting follows.

Tables have also been extended from Markdown:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell


Highlighting for code in Jekyll is done using Pygments or Rouge. This theme makes use of Rouge by default.

{% highlight js %}
// count to ten
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

// count to twenty
var j = 0;
while (j < 20) {
    j++;
    console.log(j);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Type Theme uses KaTeX to display maths. Equations such as $$S_n = a \times \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$$ can be displayed inline.

Alternatively, they can be shown on a new line:

$$ f(x) = \int \frac{2x^2+4x+6}{x-2} $$
