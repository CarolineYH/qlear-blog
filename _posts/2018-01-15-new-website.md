Welcome to our new website! Since QLEAR launched, our user base and product features have changed significantly. Taking what we've learned over these past four years, we are deep into a full product redesign to better meet your needs. The release of this new company website and domain, QLEAR.io marks the first step in better communicating the full potential of QLEAR.

You may have noticed that we've broadened our horizon. QLEAR is no longer concerned only with helping you understand indoor air   quality, but *all* environmental factors that affect the environmental quality of the built world. While air quality will continue to remain a core concentration, we also now have limited support for all types of environmental quality data, such as electricity, light, sound, etc. We've also seen the industry move closer to real-time data requirements for certifications such as RESET, LEED, WELL, etc. As the first RESET Accredited Data Provider, QLEAR has been at the leading edge of this movement. We plan to stay at the lead and are actively working on bring more real-time certifications onto QLEAR.

In order to meet these new requirements, we've already begun to completely reimagine QLEAR's interface in order to better support this broader scope. We'll be rolling out these new features and interfaces soon, soliciting feedback along the way. This is onkly the initial step in reimagining QLEAR, and we are excited for this new chapter in QLEAR's story.

Finally, we've moved our primary domain from QLEAR.build to QLEAR.io. As a global company, we found that the QLEAR.build domain was unfortunately causing problems for some customers. Giving QLEAR its much-needed branding update provided a good opportunity to give it a more suitable domain for all our customers as well. This transition should be seamless, but if you do run into problems, please reach out at support@qlear.io and we'll correct the issue quickly!
