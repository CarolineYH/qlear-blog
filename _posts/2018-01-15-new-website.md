Welcome to our new website! We've been working hard over the past few months to better understand how our users understand and use QLEAR. Taking what we've learned, we are deep into a full product redesign to better meet your needs. Today, we are excited to release the first part of this process, our company website and domain QLEAR.io.

Since QLEAR launched nearly four years ago, our user base and product features have changed significantly, and in our research we found that many were uncertain of exactly how QLEAR works, and all the ways it can help them improve the indoor environment. This new website marks the first step in better communicating the potential of QLEAR.

First and foremost, you may have noticed that we've broadened our horizon. QLEAR is no longer concerned only with helping you understand Indoor Air Quality, but *all* environmental factors that effect the environmental quality of the built world. While air will continue to remain a core concentration, we also now have limited support for all types of environmental quality data, such as electricity, light, sound, etc. We've also seen the industry move closer to real-time data requirements for certifications such as RESET, LEED, WELL, etc. As the first RESET-ready cloud provider, QLEAR has been at the leading edge of this movement. We plan to stay on this leading edge. We are actively working bring more real-time certifcations besides RESET into QLEAR, and to support *all* real-time data requirements they may have.

In order to meet these new requirements, we've already begun to completely reimagine QLEAR's interface in order to better support this broader scope. We'll be rolling these new features and interfaces soon and will be soliciting feedback from you, our users. This is only the first step in reimagining QLEAR, and we are excited for this new chapter in QLEAR's story.

Finally, we've moved our primary domain from QLEAR.build to QLEAR.io. As a global company, we found that the QLEAR.build domain was unfortunately causing problems for some customers. Giving QLEAR its much-needed branding update provided a good opportunity to give it a more suitable domain for all our customers as well. This transition should be seamless. All QLEAR.build URL and email addresses should automatically redirect to qlear.io without any issue. If you do run into problems, please reach out at support@qlear.io and we'll correct the issue quickly!
